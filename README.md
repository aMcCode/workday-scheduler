# Work Day Scheduler Starter Code

# Description
This application allows the user to record daily events in a planner. The planner displays the current date and flags present, past and future events. Events are saved so that when the app is opened after being closed, the user's activities are not lost.

The following screenshot illustrates the functionality of the application:

As always, updates are needed:
--Either clear the tasks when the date changes or have the app save data for multiple days and allow the user to move between them.
